## Digital Scholar, Project Manager, Strategic Planner

The Humanities no longer need to be the purview of solo scholars stuck in their ivory towers. With the growth of digital tools, there is an increasing need for skilled project managers to bring scholars together to work collaboratively. 

As the Project Manager and Head of the Steering Committee for the [Princeton Geniza Project](princeton.geniza.edu), I have spent four years building a new relational database, website, and work culture for undergraduates, graduate students, and senior scholors.

Are you trying to get a digital humanities project off the ground? I can help you:
- Manage your project with the academic experience to appreciate your sources and treat them with care
- Think creatively about other audiences that will benefit from your project
- Plan how to create and build your database in a way that will work for your sources and be sustainable on the web.
